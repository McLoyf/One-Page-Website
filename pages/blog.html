        A little rant about chess
    </h2>
    <h3>
        by Bobert Stevenson
    </h3>
    <p>
        You know what drives me <em>crazy</em> about chess?
        The way people romanticize it like it’s some pure,
        flawless test of intellect and artistry, when in
        reality half the time it feels like a minefield of
        memorization and psychological traps. People talk about
        “the beauty of the game” and “infinite possibilities,”
        but
        let’s be honest: the first 15 moves of any serious game have
        been dissected, catalogued, and regurgitated a <em>million</em> times
        over. Openings aren’t creative expression; they’re weaponized
        history. If you don’t know your Sicilian lines or your Ruy
        López sidelines, you’re not "exploring ideas,"
        you’re just getting steamrolled by someone who crammed last night.
        How is that romantic? That’s like calling
        standardized testing "art".
    </p>
    <p>
        And then there’s this false notion that chess is purely
        logical, that if you just calculate hard enough you’ll find
        the truth of the position. <strong>Nonsense</strong>.
        Chess is emotional warfare disguised as geometry. You’re
        sitting across from
        someone who’s trying to set a time bomb three moves deep in
        a variation you thought was safe, waiting for you to blink
        so they can spring it and make you feel like an idiot.
        You don’t lose because you weren’t “smart enough,”
        you lose
        because you’re human—because you got tired, or nervous, or
        you thought a knight fork looked scarier than it was. That’s
        not a perfect system of logic; that’s gladiatorial psychology
        dressed up in a board game.
    </p>
    <p>
        And don’t even get me started on the culture around it.
        Everyone loves to parade out the image of chess as this
        noble, intellectual pursuit. Sit in a park long enough
        and you’ll hear some guy explaining how “chess is life,”
        as if moving a wooden horse in an L-shape somehow
        encapsulates the struggles of existence. Meanwhile
        , in the online chess world, it’s just people
        rage-quitting, spamming emotes, or playing bullet
        at 2 a.m. until their brains are fried. Half the
        players are addicted to the dopamine hit of
        “one more game,” and the other half are
        pretending
        like they’re Carlsen’s heir while blundering their
        queens in five moves.
    </p>
    <p>
        But here’s the <strong>kicker</strong>: despite all of this,
        <em>despite</em> how infuriatingly self-serious and
        hypocritical and exhausting chess can be… I still
        can’t quit it. Because every so often, when the fog
        of calculation clears and you see the board line
        up in a way that feels like poetry—when a rook
        slides into the perfect file, when a knight
        leaps into an outpost like it was destined to
        be there—it’s intoxicating. Chess is
        maddening precisely because it keeps dangling
        that sense of transcendence in front of you.
        It’s a game that makes you love it even while
        you’re cursing it. And maybe that’s the real
        beauty: not in the moves, not in the openings,
        but in the fact that it keeps pulling us back in
        , no matter how much we pretend to hate it.

        Bro you’re wildin’ with this whole rant 😂
        “openings are just memorization” — yeah <em>okay</em>,
        and reading words is just memorizing the alphabet
        🤦‍♂️. Like, come on, you lose one game to the
        Sicilian and suddenly the whole sport is ruined?
        <em>Lmaooo.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        And calling chess “psychological warfare” is
        <em>hilarious</em> 💀. No dude, it’s not war, it’s just
        you tilting after hanging a pawn. Don’t blame
        the board for your emotional damage 💀😂.
    </p>
    <p>
        Also you really said “the culture is cringe”
        while writing a <em>4 paragraph</em> diary entry about
        how a rook sliding into a file feels like poetry
        🤣🤣. Bruh, that’s the <em>same</em> energy as the park
        dudes you’re clowning. Pot, meet kettle.
    </p>
    <p>
        End of the day, you don’t hate chess.
        You’re just salty that you're clapped 😂
        . Don’t dress it up as philosophy when it’s
        just cope.
