    <h1>Welcome to our school's chess club website!</h1>

    <h2>This is a welcoming and cozy place to enjoy chess</h2>
    <p>
        Our school's chess club is more about enjoying ourselves, having something
        relaxing to do. Get our minds off of the hectic environment school
        can be and focus our energy on chess for a bit.

        This is an example paragraph because I can't think about what else to add that is 
        in theme with the website concept

        Here is my favorite quote by a famous poet "It drops deep as it does in my breath
        I never sleep, 'cause sleep is the cousin of death 
        Beyond the walls of intelligence, life is defined" - Nas
